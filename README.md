# Todo List (Procrastinate with more guilt!)

A todo list app built using HTML5, CSS3, JS(ES6), and Webpack 5!

## Resources Used

During the project, I have referred to the resources below for building the UI:

- Tailwind CSS color palette for designing a color theme: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- Google Fonts Library.

## Features

- Built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS(ES6).
- ES6 Modules bundled using Webpack 5.
- Create a project to begin!
- Add a task using a modal pop-up asking for task title, priority (select), due date, and any details you'd like to add.
- The app has persistence, so when you refresh, your projects and their individual tasks will be there (thanks, local storage!).
- On first run, the app will create a "Hello World" project with three tasks in it showing varying degrees of priority settings.
- Built with soft colors to not tire the eyes ðŸ¤“.
- Soft, minimal design language to enable the user to just focus on the content.
